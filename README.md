### 3. Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
3. Create Firestore Database
4. Copy your Firebase configuration
5. Update `/lib/firebase.ts` with your config:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 4. Initialize Sample Data
After Firebase setup, run the setup function once to create initial data:

```typescript
// In browser console or setup page
import { setupFirebaseData, createInitialAdminUser } from './lib/setupFirebaseData';

// Create admin user
await createInitialAdminUser();

// Setup sample teams and players
await setupFirebaseData();
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Default Login Credentials

After running the setup:
- **Email**: admin@cricket.com
